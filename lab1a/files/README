lab1a.c:
lab1a.c is the source code of the lab1a program. As stated in the Lab 1
Specifications, when run without the --shell option, it reads input
from the keyboard into a buffer. The received characters are written back
out to the display. Upon detecting the escape sequence (^D), the program
exits. When run with the --shell option, it forks and executes a shell.
The keyboard input is piped to the shell process's stdin, and the shell's
stdout and stderr are piped to the terminal process, which writes
them out to the display. Essentially, this is a pseudo-shell program.
By default, the program will exit with code 0. In cases of unrecognized
arguments or system call failure, the program with exit with code 1.

Makefile:
Makefile is the makefile of the lab1a program. It supports the following
targets:

   clean
