<h1>Project 4C<br>
Internet Of Things Security</h1>
</center>

<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
<p>
The Internet Of Things is populated with an ever expanding
range of sensors and appliances.  Initially such devices
were likely to be connected to monitoring and control 
devices over purely local/personal networks 
(e.g. infra-red, Bluetooth, ZigBee), but it is
increasingly common to connect such devices 
(directly or via a bridge) to the internet.
This enables remote monitoring and control, but it also
exposes them to a variety of remote attacks.
</p>
<p>
For some targets (e.g. a national power grid or 
Uranium separation centrifuges) their stratigic importance
and need for protection should be clear.
It might not be immediatly obvious how one might hijack simple
devices (e.g. light switches or temperature/humidity sensors) 
for nefarious purposes, but:
</p><ul>
   <li> there have been numerous instances where web-cams,
   	have been hijacked to violate peoples' privacy.</li>
   <li> smart devices like routers, baby-monitors, 
   	washing machines, and even lightbulbs have been
	conscripted into <em>bot-nets</em> to mount 
	<em>Distributed Denial of Service</em>
	attacks.</li>
   <li> security researchers have been able to hijack the
   	digital controls of recent cars.</li>
   <li> consider the havoc that could be wrought by someone
   	who was able to seize control of a networked
	pace-maker or insulin pump.</li>
</ul>
Prudence suggests that all communications and control for 
IOT devices should be encrypted.
<p></p>
<p>
In this project we will extend your
embedded temperature sensor to accept commands from, and send
reports back to a network server.  You will do this over both
unencrypted and encrypted channels.
</p>

<h2>RELATION TO READING AND LECTURES:</h2>
<p>
This project applies the principles discussed in the reading and lectures on
Cryptography, Distributed Systems Security, and Secure Socket Layer encryption.
</p>

<h2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES:</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Primary: Demonstrate the ability to design, build and debug an 
    	embedded application that interacts with a central control server
	with the aid of server-side logs.</li>
    <li> Primary: Demonstrate the ability to implement a secure channel
    	using standard tools.</li>
    <li> Primary: Demonstrate the ability to research and exploit
    	a complex API, and to debug an application involving encrypted communication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DELIVERABLES:</h2>
A single compressed tarball (<tt>.tar.gz</tt>) containing:
<ul>
    <li> C source files for two embedded applications 
	(<tt>lab4c_tcp</tt> and <tt>lab4c_tls</tt>)
    	that build and run (with no errors or warnings) on an Edison.
 <!--
    <LI> a public key <tt>lab4c_server.crt</tt> that your device will use to authenticate
    	the logging server.</li>
    -->
    </li><li> A <tt>Makefile</tt> to build and test your application.
	 The higher level targets should include:
	<ul>
		<li>default ... build both versions your program</li>
		<li><strong>clean</strong> ... delete all programs and output created by the Makefile</li>
		<li><strong>dist</strong> ... create the deliverable tarball</li>
	</ul></li>
    	Note that this <tt>Makefile</tt> is intended to be executed on an Edison, but you
	may find it convenient to create a <tt>Makefile</tt> that can be run on either an
	Edison or a Linux server/desktop/notebook.
    <li> a <tt>README</tt> file containing:
	<ul>
		<li> descriptions of each of the included files and any other information about your 
			submission that you would like to bring to our attention 
	 		(e.g. research, limitations, features, testing methodology).</li>
		<li> any other comments on your submission 
			(e.g. references consulted, slip days, etc.)</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>PREPARATION:</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
   <li>Part 1 
       <ul>
       	    <li>Obtain the <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs111/projects/serverinfo.html">host name, port # and server status URL</a>
		for the TCP logging server.</li>
   	</ul>
   </li>
   <li>Part 2
       <ul>
       	    <li>Obtain the <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs111/projects/serverinfo.html">host name, port # and server status URL</a>
       	    	for the TLS logging server.</li>
	   <li>Review the documentation for the
		<a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/ssl.html">OpenSSL</a> 
		SSL/TLS library, which should already be installed on your Edison.
		You will likely want to seek out additional tutorials on using
		OpenSSL to initiate connections and verify server certificates.
	   </li>
   	</ul>
   </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Communication with a Logging Server</h3>
<p>
Write a program (called <tt>lab4c_tcp</tt>) that:
</p><ul>
   <li> builds and runs on your Edison</li>
   <li> is based on the temperature sensor application you built previously</li>
   <li> accepts the following parameters:
   	<ul>
		<li><tt>--id=</tt><em>9-digit-number</em></li>
		<li><tt>--host=</tt><em>name or address</em></li>
		<li><tt>--log=</tt><em>filename</em></li>
		<li>(required) <em>port number</em></li>
	</ul>
   	Note: that there is no <tt>--port=</tt> in front of the port number.
	      This is non-switch parameter.
   </li>
   <li> It accepts the same commands and generates the same reports as the
   	previous Edison project, but now the input and output are from/to
	a network connection to a server.
   	<ol type="1">
		<li> open a TCP connection to the server at the specified address and port</li>
		<li> immediately send (and log) an ID terminated with a newline:<br>
			<strong><tt>ID=</tt></strong><em>ID-number</em>.  This new report
			enables the server to keep track of which devices it has received 
			reports from.
		</li>
		<li> send (and log) newline terminated temperature reports over the connection </li>
		<li> process (newline terminated) commands reveived over the connection </li>
		<li> the last command sent by the server will (as before) be <tt>OFF</tt></li>
	</ol>
   </li>
   <li> as before, assume that the temperature sensor has been connected
     	to Analog input 0.</li>
</ul>
The ID number will appear in the TCP server log
(follow the
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs111/projects/serverinfo.html">TCP server URL</a>),
and will permit you to find the reports for your sessions.  
To protect your privacy, You do not have to use your student ID number, but merely
a nine-digit number that you will recognize and that will be different from the
numbers chosen by others.
<p></p>
<p>
From the server status page, you will also be able to see, for each client,
a log of all commands sent to and reports received from that client in the
most recent session.
</p>
<p>
To facilitate development and testing I wrote my program to, if compiled with a special 
(<tt>-DDUMMY</tt>) define, include mock implementations for the <tt>mraa_aio_</tt> 
functionality, enabling me to do most of my testing on my desktop.  
I then modified my Makefile run the command "<tt>uname -r</tt>", check for the 
presence of the string "<tt>edison</tt>" in that output, and if not found, build with a rule
that passed the <tt>-DDUMMY</tt> flag to <em>gcc</em>.
</p>
<h3>Part 2: Authenticated TLS Session Encryption</h3>
<p>
Write a program (called <tt>lab4c_tls</tt>) that:
</p><ul>
   <li> builds and runs on your Edison</li>
   <li> is based on the remote logging appliance build in part 1</li>
 <!--
   <li> accepts the following additional command line parameter:
   	<ul>
	<li><tt>--serverkey=</tt><em>key file</em> for server's public key</li>
	</ul>
   </li>
 -->
   <li> operates by:
   	<ol type="1">
		<li> opening a TLS connection to the server at the specified address and port.
		     <!-- and authenticating the server against a supplied
			     <a href="lab4c_server.crt">certificate</a>.
		     If the server
		     does not use the expected certificate, log an error (to both
		     standard error and to the log), close the connection, and exit.-->
		</li>
		<li> sending your student ID followed by a newline </li>
		<li> send temperature reports over the connection </li>
		<li> process commands reveived over the connection </li>
		<li> the last command sent by the server will be <tt>OFF</tt></li>
	</ol>
   </li>
</ul>
The ID number will appear in the TLS server log
(follow the
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs111/projects/serverinfo.html">TLS server URL</a>),
and will permit you to find the reports for your sessions.  
<p></p>
<p>
Note that you may choose to:
</p><ul>
	<li>write two versions of the program</li>
	<li>write a single program that can be compiled to produce two different executables</li>
	<li>write a single executable that implements both functionalities, and chooses which
	    based on the name by which it was invoked.  In this last case, your Makefile should 
	    produce two different links (with the required names) to that program.
	    </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2> SUMMARY OF EXIT CODES: </h2>
<ul>
	<li> 0: successful run</li>
	<li> 1: invalid command-line parameters (e.g. unrecognized parameter, no such host)</li>
	<li> 2: other run-time failures</li>
</ul>

<h2>SUBMISSION:</h2>
<p>
Your tarball should have a name of the form <tt>lab4c-</tt><em>studentID</em><tt>.tar.gz</tt>.
You can sanity check your submission with this 
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs111/projects/P4C_check.sh">test script</a>
which should run on your Edison or (if with appropriately dummied sensor access) on your usual Linux development environment.
</p>
<p>
Note that the sanity checker works, in part, by checking the server logs for entries corresponding
to the student ID you have given as a parameter.  Thus, in order to pass the sanity check, you must
have had recent successful sessions using your own student ID number (or at least the same number
you have used to name your submission tarball).
</p>
<p>
Your <strong>README</strong> file (and all source files) must include lines of the form:
</p><ul>
	<strong>NAME:</strong> <em>your name</em><br>
	<strong>EMAIL:</strong> <em>your email</em><br>
	<strong>ID:</strong> <em>your student ID</em>
</ul>
<p></p>
