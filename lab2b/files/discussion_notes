array of list heads
      SortedList_insert(&listhead[listno], e);
      where e is the element you want to insert

      each list head has a mutex, in an array of corresponding mutexes
      lock -> insert -> unlock

      apply all locks -> then calculate entire list length
      	    length of all lists in the arrays

      hash is "%number of lists"
