lab0.c:
lab0.c is the source code of the lab0 program. As stated in the Lab 0
Specifications, it copies its standard input to its standard output by
read(2)-ing from the file descriptor 0 and write(2)-ing to file descriptor 1.
It accepts the following (optional) command line arguments:
   -i filename, --input=filename
      use the specified file as standard input
   -o filename, --output=filename
      use the specified file as standard output
   -s, --segfault
      force a segmentation fault
   -c, --catch
      catch the segmentation fault

Makefile:
Makefile is the makefile of the lab0 program. It supports the following
targets:
   default
      build the lab0 executable
   check
      a smoke-test on the functionality of the program
   clean
      delete all makefile-created files
   dist
      build the distribution tarball

backtrace.png:
backtrace.png is a screenshot of the backtrace of lab0 ran with gdb using the
--segfault option. The backtrace is from after the fault.

breakpoint.png:
breakpoint.png is the screenshot of the value of "ptr", which is 0x0 or NULL.
"ptr" is the pointer used to cause the segmentation fault when the --segfault
option is used.

README:
README describes the submission files and the smoke-test cases.

Smoke-test cases:
The smoke-test cases are the following (exit codes 0-4, 139):
   testEC0_1
      checks the case that there are no options used
   testEC0_2
      checks the case that the --input and --output options are used
   testEC0_3
      checks if the input file matches the output file using cmp
   testEC1
      checks the case that there is an unrecognized argument
   testEC2
      checks the case that it cannot open the input file
   testEC3
      checks the case that it cannot open the output file
   testEC4
      checks the case that the --segfault and --catch options are used
   testEC139
      checks the case that just the --segfault option is used
